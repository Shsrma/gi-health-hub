This folder holds image assets for the project.

File: `operating_room_person.jpg` (currently a placeholder)

To replace the placeholder with the attached image:
1. Download the attached image from the chat.
2. Save it as `src/assets/operating_room_person.jpg` (overwrite the placeholder), or choose a different name and update any imports that reference it.

If you'd like, I can embed the actual image here—reply with the filename you prefer and confirm, and I'll add it.
